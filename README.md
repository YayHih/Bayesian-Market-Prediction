# ðŸ“ˆ S&P 500 Stock Price Analysis  

## Overview  
This Python script reads a list of S&P 500 companies, fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, analyzes significant price changes, and saves the results to a CSV file.  

## Features  
âœ… Reads company details from a tab-separated file (`sandp500.txt`).  
âœ… Fetches historical stock data using Yahoo Finance API.  
âœ… Identifies significant daily price changes (default: Â±5%).  
âœ… Saves results to `significant_changes.csv` and logs missing tickers in `not_found.txt`.  

## Requirements  
- **Python 3.x**  
- Install dependencies:  
  ```bash
  pip install requests pandas beautifulsoup4 yfinance
Usage

Copy
Edit

Results will be saved in significant_changes.csv.
Configuration
